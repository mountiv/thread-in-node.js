# Thread in Node.js

This tutorial is help you understanding thread in Node.js.

## Concept and Idea

Node.js provides a single-threaded JavaScript run-time surface that prevents code from running multiple operations in parallel. If your application typically employs synchronous execution, you may encounter blocks during long-running operations.
However, Node.js itself is a multi-threaded application.
Multi-threading can offer substantial performance improvements for CPU-bound workflows by allowing arbitrary work to be performed in parallel. Although Node.js doesn't offer real multi-threading, you can create something similar with the `worker_threads` module.
The worker_threads module implements a form of threading that lets you add parallelism to your own application. Code executed in a worker thread runs in a separate child process, preventing it from blocking your main application.
Worker threads are not real threads in the traditional sense. They're distinct processes, which means they can't directly access the execution context of their parents. Communication between worker threads and your application is facilitated by an event-based messaging system.
Although worker threads don't turn Node.js into a true multi-threaded language, the difference is academic in many real-world scenarios. They implement a convenient mechanism for running several execution "threads" concurrently, letting you take intensive work out of the main loop.

## Worker thread use cases

Worker threads can be employed anywhere you're using expensive CPU-bound operations. They're not suitable for accelerating I/O work because of the overhead associated with each thread. Node.js' built-in async I/O utilities will be quicker and more efficient for filesystem and network tasks.

While there's no shortage of situations where worker threads can help, here are some especially common use cases where you could benefit from them:

### Image resizing

Resizing large images can take several seconds, and the delays add up quickly if you need to generate multiple sizes. This is common in applications that convert uploaded photos into thumbnails, as well as small and large formats. You could use three worker threads to start generating all the sizes at the same time, reducing the total duration of the process.

### Video compression

Video compression is one of the most taxing compute tasks around. Worker threads can accelerate it by processing multiple frames in parallel, then posting the results back to the main thread.

### File encryption and other cryptography

Cryptographic operations are intentionally complex. Encrypting and decrypting files, generating secret keys, and performing signature verification can all create perceptible delays in a program when these tasks are run on the main thread.

### Sorting and searching large amounts of data

Filtering and sorting data requires extensive iteration to compare each value. It can be accelerated by using worker threads to look at multiple pieces of data in parallel.

### Complex mathematical operations

Mathematical computation - such as generating primes, factorizing large numbers, and complex data analysis - is inherently CPU-intensive. Performing some of the work in a separate thread can free up the main loop to work on other tasks.

The slowdown in all these operations is caused by the CPU spending a lot of time executing code, as opposed to reading data from disk or the network. They're iterative tasks, so increasing the number of passes performed in parallel is the best route to a performance improvement. Worker threads are a mechanism for achieving this.
